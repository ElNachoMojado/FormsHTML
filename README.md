<h1>Forms in HTML</h1>
<h2>Sign-up Form from the Advanced HTML & CSS module in TOP</h2>

<h3>Before I started</h3>
<p>I've taken a break from the TOP course for months and now I feel like I'm just starting to learn from the beginning.</p>
<p>This project entails making a Sign-up form in HTML and styling it according to what I learned from the HTML Forms lectures.</p>
